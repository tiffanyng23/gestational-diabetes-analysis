Dataset is from a study that measured various clinical factors in pregnant women that are shown to be altered in gestational diabetes.

## Visceral Adipose Tissue and Gestational Diabetes
[Maternal visceral adipose tissue during the first half of pregnancy predicts gestational diabetes at the time of delivery â€“ a cohort study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7192370/)

Visceral adipose tissue has been linked with cardiometabolic dysfunction (e.g insulin resistance, diabetes, heart disease). BMI has been shown to be linked with gestational diabetes but this metric does not differentiate between muscle, fat, and bone mass; nor does it indicate fat distribution around the body. Visceral adipose tissue therefore may be a better indicator of cardiometabolic risk. In this study, visceral adipose tissue was measured in a cohort of 133 women in the first half of pregnancy to assess if it could be used to predict gestational diabetes at the end of pregnancy.

## Plotly Dash App

I created an interactive app using Plotly Dash where users can see visualizations of data and identify variable trends or any correlations between variables.
